# Introduction

This project provides "Fine Tuning" and "Transfer Learning" algorithm along with sample code.


# Directory Structure

Directory structure is as follows.

./data  
├─ dataset  
└─ results  

./src  
├─ modeldev  
├─ mylib
├─ analysis_nn  
├─ traindatadev  


# Code Abstract and Usage

1. Set training data in the "./data/dataset"
2. Start Training with "./src/modeldev" and get traingin result in the "./data/result".
3. Analyze training result with "./src/analysis_nn" script in the "./data/result".
