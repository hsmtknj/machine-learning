# Machine Learning with Python
This is a project for me to understand "Machine Learning" with Python.
I make sure my understanding by implementing algorithms of machine learning with coding.

The following directories include algorithm implementation which is related to directories title.

## neuralnet directory

This directory has algorithm implementation which is related to "Neural Networks".

The following algorithms have been implemented.
And each directory has the source code about that.

- cnn  : Convolutional Neural Network
- cvae : Conditional Variational Autoencoder
- mlp  : Multilayer Perceptron
- rnn  : Recurrent Neural Network
- sda  : Stacked denoising Autoencoder
- vae  : Variational Autoencoder


## supervised directory

This directory has algorithm implementation which is related to "Supervised Learning" excluding "Neural Network"

- coming soon


## unsupervised directory

This directory has algorithm implementation which is related to "Unsupervised Learning" excluding "Neural Network"

- kmeans : k-means algorithm


## data_analysis directory

This directory has source codes samples for analysis.

- data : some data set
- src  : analysis codes samples
